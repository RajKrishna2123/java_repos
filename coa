information transfer from one register to another is designated in 
symbolic form by means id a replacement operator is known as register 
transfer 
                    R2 <- R1
data is transfered bit by bit form right to left for eg
                    R1                R2
                    1|1|0|1     ->    1|1|0|1
*note :- (<-) this operator is known as replacement operator
- register transfer using control function 
    normally, we want the transfer to occur only under a predetermined 
    control condition using if-then statement .
        
        for example if (p=1)then(R2<-R1)
    where p is a control signal generated in tha coontrol section.
    a control fuction is a boolean variable that is eqaul to 1or 0 
            P:(R2<-R1) #method of reprentation
